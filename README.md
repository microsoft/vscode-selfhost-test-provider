# VS Code Selfhost Test Provider

This extension is a [test provider](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/107467) for the VS Code repo. It's purpose-built for running tests in VS Code and will not be functional elsewhere.

**This has now moved** into the VS Code repo as a workspace extension https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/.vscode/extensions/vscode-selfhost-test-provider
